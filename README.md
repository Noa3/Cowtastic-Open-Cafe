## License Options

You have two paths for licensing depending on your goals:

### üîì Option A ‚Äì Fully Open Source (Allow Commercial Use)

- Use: **GPLv3** or **GPLv3-or-later**
- Commercial use: ‚úÖ Allowed
- Modifications must stay open-source
- You **cannot** restrict resale

### üîí Option B ‚Äì Non-Commercial (Recommended if you want to protect content)

Split license:

| Component       | License           | Commercial Use | ShareAlike |
|----------------|-------------------|----------------|------------|
| Code (C#)       | MIT / Apache 2.0  | ‚úÖ Allowed      | ‚ùå          |
| Assets / Audio  | CC BY-NC-SA 4.0   | ‚ùå Forbidden    | ‚úÖ Required |

This means:
- Your code is open and usable by others
- Media/voices can be remixed or reused, **but not sold**
- Derivative projects must use the same license for media

> ‚ùó Note: **Creative Commons licenses are not OSI-certified open source**  
> They are commonly used for assets (sounds, art, models) in games.
